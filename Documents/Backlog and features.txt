Features:

1.	Read data from sensors
2.	Take picture (anyone who enters or leaves room)
3.	Provide user interface and show data from sensors and the last captured picture
4.	Register users in a  database -> open “door” via Bluetooth MAC address, 
        when a registered user is nearby (measure the power of the signal…it can be done relatively easy)
5.	If the 4th feature is done then we can modify things a little bit:
	a.	Take picture only about the unregistered users (to find the “bad” guys)
	b.	Save data about the registered users (when entered or left room)
6.	Provide statistics
7.	Additional: Use of a GSM module in order to send notifications when motion is detected, temperature/humidity is out of bounds, etc.
8.      Of course documentation is needed.

Backlog:

1. Investigate technologies
2. Investigate hardware
3. Connect sensors and camera to the Raspberry Pi and read data 
4. Implement server
5. Send data to the server via MQTT
6. Show data on UI
7. Create database with the users and data
8. Identify the registered users
9. Implement the functionality to recognise if a person leaves or enters room
10. Provide statistics and show them on UI
11. Send notifications via FONA (GSM module)
12. Create documentation and put everything together (Architecture, Use Case Diagram, Component Diagram, etc)
13. Create final presentation
